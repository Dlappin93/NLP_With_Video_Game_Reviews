The fact that someone can draw 30+ cards in a single turn and end up with a board totaling over 100 damage just speaks volumes about the thought behind some of the cards and their effects.I don't recommend the game for anyone who wants to play casually, only those who would play it \"hardcore\".\n",

      "Early Access ReviewOut of the many battle royale games I've played over the past year, this game has by far been the best. Despite my small amount of hours, this game has actually felt like no other. With the obvious elements from fortnite and the obvious elements from PUBG this game is the perfect mix with some cool additions of it's own creation.The Snowboarding, Gliding and Climbing is cool as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Although the mechanics are a bit janky and there are elements throughout the game that show through it's early access. This game is still better than PUBG and Fortnite.The shooting is satisfying and not overcomplicated, the inventory system works and isn't overcomplicated, the map is actually interesting and I actually want to explore it. The areas are impressive I.E The Mine.It's simple, it works and is actually a lot of fun to play. I'd sooner spend 26 quid on cosmetics on this game that 26 quid on PUBG.I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game.EDIT: I've read a lot about the terms of service in this game and here is what I have to say.All Ring of Elysiums terms of service say is that they have an intrusive anti-cheat, it's needed cause in china cheating is actually illegal and you can get jailtime for it. That's why the game has HWID bans too. You get the same kind of Anti-Cheat when you play ESEA or Faceit or any game with battleye or infact most anti-cheats nowadays. Cheats are so hard to detect so the Anti-Cheats have to be so much more intrusive, it's a small price to pay for a decent game experience.We've all experienced our fair share of sketchy deaths but it terms of blatent cheating I haven't seen any as of yet. As for the sketchy deaths if you look back it was probably just someone got lucky etc because I really haven't died to a lot of BS.As for the company selling your data, there is no genuine hard proof of that. All just speculation.\n",
